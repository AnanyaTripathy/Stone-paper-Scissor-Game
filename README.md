# Stone-paper-Scissor-Game
Stone/Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
These shapes are "rock/stone" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 
"Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

A player who decides to play rock/stone will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock/stone crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), 
but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock/stone"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
